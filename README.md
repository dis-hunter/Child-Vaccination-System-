<h2>2) Business Understanding</h2> </hr> </br>
In kenya, most of our hospitals still use the old vacciniation system, where records are stored in paper or if the hospital has an advanced system, the information is restricted only to the hospital faculty. This limits how a parent is able to track their children's information.
KingaBora is a solution to the problem, by leveraging the current technology, we provide a platform for parents to be able to keep track of their children's vaccination progress, a parent can see their child's height and weight progress in the various vaccination stages and the vaccine administered history. </br>

<h2>3) Our Product Vision</h2> </br> </br>
For parents/guardians who want to ensure great health for their child and protect them 
from preventable diseases. The KingaBora web application is the ideal solution that helps 
parents keep track of their child’s vaccination schedules, provides timely information 
about upcoming vaccinations, and locates the nearest vaccination centers. Unlike other 
services, it uses the latest technology to deliver personalized alerts, real-time updates, and 
thorough record-keeping. Our product ensures that your child's vaccinations are always on 
track, giving you peace of mind and confidence in their health and safety. KingaBora offers 
excellent support, helping your child grow healthy and secure.</br>
